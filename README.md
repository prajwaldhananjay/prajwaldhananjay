I am a software engineer with 3+ years of experience building scalable, reliable systems using Java, Spring Boot, and SQL. I care deeply about clean architecture, well-tested code, and building products that solve real problems.  
Currently, I'm exploring cloud-native development and working toward my AWS Developer Associate certification.
